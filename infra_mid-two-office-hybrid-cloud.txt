The purpose of this document is to describe an office systems build out for hybrid cloud infrastructure.

This office/datacenter model covers the basics needed for a hybrid cloud with strong security controls and enterprise compute power.

There are two offices/datacenters in this model. Employee size for sysadmin teams between 3 and 12 people spread between the two locations.
