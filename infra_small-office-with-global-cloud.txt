This file describes a small office and a heavily cloud service focused model.
The office has firewalls, powerful workstations with local databases, and
calls out to orchestrate load balancers and products in any clouds it manages.

Product traffic goes straight into the cloud services and never goes near the local infra.
Local infra runs analytics, configurations, orchestration, backups, monitoring, and master databases.

This is for a sysadmin staff of one to four.
