The purpose of this document is to describe a modern internal PKI structure for
interacting with private (internal) service mesh (cloud) services.



Internal Public Key Infrastructure aka Internal PKI
==================================



[ self serve portal service ] is a web GUI service with sessions authenticated by the ISM (see https://github.com/jpegleg/idealism-systems/blob/master/services_user-identity-management.txt)
where approved users can submit a CSR and receive an internal use only certificate.

[ ACME server ] is a service that will issue certificates automatically to your certbot configured services.


Both the ACME server/s and the self serve portal/s will sign certificate requests with the appropriate 
intermediate for the situation.
