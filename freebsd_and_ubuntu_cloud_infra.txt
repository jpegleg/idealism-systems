So, turns out FreeBSD is better at network storage than linux is. Okay, so lets use freenas for storage.
Turns out Ubuntu is good at kubernetes, more than most OSs and distros, because it is developed on there and the kernel
version in Ubuntu is best aligned to the software functionality. Because of these concepts/assumptions, we can see
a high performance infrastructure based on the two of them.

Each DC has FreeNAS replicating to the other DCs, and replicating to a backup FreeNAS within the DC.

Each DC has 7 physical Ubuntu servers running microk8s kubernetes, mounted to the shared FreeNAS SAN mount for persistent storage.

Each DC has 2 physical FreeBSD servers as physical firewalls and switches.

Each DC has 3 physical FreeBSD servers for IDS and security services.

Each DC has 1 physical Ubuntu workstation for ansible, monitoring, terraform, etc.

Make the FreeNAS's huge if you can, put SSDs on the primary if you can.

Make the Ubuntu servers huge if you can, 256+ GB RAM, 24+ cores of CPU, 2+ TB local disk.

Make the physical FreeBSD servers have lots of physical network ports, 24+ GB RAM, 8+ cores of CPU, 200+ GB local storage.

Make the Ubuntu workstation a true monster, 64+ GB RAM, 32+ cores, 4+ TB of local storage.

So this is all the physical devices.

Then all of the product is run in containers with microk8s kubernetes on the Ubuntu servers, 
automatic fail over between all DCs and Ubuntu servers.

 [ FreeBSD FreeNAS Backup ]   

This is trying to say, the FreeBSD FW has to be updated in person, no remote access allowed. 
The IDS and FreeNAS sends data to the ubuntu workstation for monitoring/analysis, through the firewall/switch.
All of the Ubuntu devices traffic has to go through the FreeBSD firewall, including the workstation.
All of the FreeNAS traffic has to go through the firewall/switch devices.
The IDS devices are the only ones allowed to connect to the internet/outside without the firewalls.
